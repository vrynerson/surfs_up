## Overview of the analysis: 
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of the Surf's Up analysis is to predict if an ice cream and surf shop will be successful all year round. Weather data on the island of Oahu from June and December 2010 to 2018 was organized and statistical analysis was run to determine the viability of year-round sales.


## Results: 
### Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* Lowest temperature in June was 64 degrees F and December's lowest temperature was 56 degrees F. 
* Highest temperatures were 85 degrees F and 83 degrees F for June and December, respectively.
* The average temperature during June was 75 degrees F. The average temperature for December was 71 degrees F.

## Summary: 
### Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
Looking at the statistics for the weather data from both June and December, the temperatures only differ by no more than 8 degrees in each statistical category. The highest temperatures were very close togther, only differing by two degrees. Seeing how modern wetsuits allow consumers to surf at water temperatures as low as 45 degrees F, surfing at the lowest temperature of 56 degrees in December would not be out of the question for devoted surfers. 

Looking into the ice cream portion of the surf shop, this would be a little more volitile. 75% of the time, the temperature is over 69 degrees in December. This is sufficient enough weather to make up for the other 25% of the time where sales could be lower. Adding an aspect like coffee could help sales as that can be served hot or cold. Adding a different service such as lockers for surfers to store their belongings safely can add monetary value.   

An additional query such as looking into weather data quarterly intead of bi-yearly could give a bigger picture of weather during the whole year in Oahu. Furthermore, gathering data on the actual temperature of the water could give a better idea to how many customers would be out on the water.
